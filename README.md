- Hi!

One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. While I also bake, it generally takes too long to keep my interest. That being said, below is the recipe for my ideal chocolate chip cookies. They come out chewy and gooey with crispy edges.
Ingredients:
  - 0.5 cups of granulated sugar
  - 0.75 cups of dark brown sugar, packed
  - 0.5 teaspoon of salt (I prefer to use himalayan pink salt at a medium-fine coarseness)
  - 0.5 cups of salted butter, melted
  - 1 egg (room temperature)
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1.25 cups of all-purpose flour, sifted (avoid overpacking)
  - 0.5 teaspoons of baking soda
  - 8 oz of dark chocolate chunks (72% cocoa is preferred)
 
Preparation:
1) Melt butter on the stovetop over low heat. Stirring regularly, lightly brown the butter. Let cool for 5 minutes.
2) In a large bowl, add dark brown sugar and granulated sugar. Mix to combine. Add melted butter and whisk until it forms a smooth paste.
3) Whisk in the room temperature egg, vanilla, salt, and baking soda until thick, light-brown ribbons form.
4) Fold in the flour until it is just incorporated.
5) Fold in the chocolate chunks.
6) Chill the dough thoroughly. Minimum of 30 minutes. Ideally 6 hours to overnight.
7) Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
8) Keeping the dough cold, form the cookies into tight 1.5 inch balls and space them evenly over the parchment.
9) Bake for 9-11 minutes or until the cookie dough has flattened out.
10) With the cookies still in the oven, increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for another 4-5 minutes until the edges start to brown. The cookies will look very soft and almost underdone.
11) Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
12) Enjoy!
